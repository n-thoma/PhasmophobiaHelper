The Tier I D.O.T.S Projector will not work if Flashlights are turned off in custom difficulty settings. Ghosts with D.O.T.S evidence will occasionally enter a 'D.O.T.S state'. During this, a faint silhouette of the ghost will be visible only when it passes through the laser grid. The ghost will also walk towards the nearest player if there is one in the same room, or towards a random waypoint if no players are nearby. While these silhouettes are visible to the naked eye (unless the ghost is a Goryo), a video camera with night vision may allow for better visibility. This also means that D.O.T.S can be tracked simultaneously alongside Ghost Orbs. Dead players cannot see the D.O.T.S state by any means. Though the D.O.T.S Projector is an electronic equipment, only the Tier I D.O.T.S. Projector when activated and held will attract the ghost to the player during a hunt, and they are otherwise safe to hold onto."

This will increase the silhouette's contrast against the background. Having two D.O.T.S Projectors placed can allow the silhouette to be visible for longer as it moves across the lighting radius. If the favourite room is small, consider placing the D.O.T.S Projector in a neighbouring room to aid visibility. The Projector emits a substantial amount of light when placed. Investigators can use them for illumination, especially with a spare Projector or when D.O.T.S evidence can be safely crossed off. Note that the D.O.T.S projector light does not mitigate sanity drain. The Tier II and III D.O.T.S Projectors can be placed on some ceilings in a few maps, which may allow the light to cover a room with much more consistency. This is especially useful for the tier III projector, whose sweeping motions and cone-shaped light area can cause the ghost to potentially leave its light prematurely depending on the ghost's and the projector's movement. The green light emitted may obscure nearby fingerprints or footprints; look carefully or remove the projector when checking for ultraviolet evidence. Some visual effects such as freezing breath or Incense smoke will reflect the D.O.T.S Projector's light. Be careful to not confuse them with a D.O.T.S silhouette. There is currently a bug where the ghost can initiate a ghost event or a hunt while in 'D.O.T.S state'. This will make the ghost entirely invisible and nearly quiet (footsteps will not be heard) outside of a D.O.T.S. Projector's range."

Holding F will show the default effective range for the crucifix; this is a translucent sphere with a radius depending on its tier level (even if the ghost has a different effective range): Tier I: 3 metres, Tier II: 4 metres, Tier III: 5 metres. When the ghost attempts to initiate a hunt within the crucifix's range, the hunt will fail to begin, and a charge will be used. The ghost is then teleported back to its favourite room. Each time a crucifix successfully prevents a hunt, an EMF Level 2 reading is created, with a 25% chance for this to be EMF Level 5 if it is one of the ghost's evidences. For the Demon, the crucifix's effective range is increased by 50% for each tier: Tier I: 4.5 metres, Tier II: 6 metres, Tier III: 7.5 metres. The Tier I crucifix only has one charge, while tier II and tier III both have two charges. Each time it blocks a hunt attempt, a burning effect will appear, and the crucifix will glow visually before fading slightly darker. On first use, one arm of the crucifix will disappear. On second use, more parts of the crucifix will disappear. If a player-held crucifix successfully prevents a hunt attempt, it will automatically be thrown on the ground. After the crucifix is completely burnt, the crucifix will be useless and have no further effect on the ghost. In addition, the crucifix will not work if: The ghost is not within the specified range (even if the crucifix is located in the favourite room), A cursed possession is used to initiate a cursed hunt (Except for in the case of an unused tier III crucifix, which can be used to stop a cursed hunt at the cost of both its charges), A hunt has already started/is in progress. Each time a crucifix is used, the ghost must wait a minimum of 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before attempting to initiate another hunt. The crucifix range is not limited by any obstacle such as walls and doors. This includes exterior walls, which means that it is possible for crucifixes to be used outside provided the ghost is within its range inside the investigation area. 42 Edgefield Road is a good example of this, where a ghost near the front of the house, even upstairs, could possibly use up a crucifix still hanging on the van wall.",

Throwing a lit firelight/one falling with sufficient velocity (Tiers I and II only), placing it in the inventory, or leaving it out in heavy rain (Tiers I and II only) will cause it to extinguish. When a player is within 2 metres of a lit firelight, it will slow passive sanity drain that results from being in the dark, at a rate depending on the firelight's tier level.

In larger maps like Brownstone High School or Sunny Meadows Mental Institution, firelights may be helpful as navigation markers for important areas such as the fuse box, ghost room, or exit door(s), though they are not as reliable as UV lights or spare flashlights, as firelights both burn out after a time (except for tier III) and can be blown out by the ghost. As firelights are not electronic, they are not affected by hunts and will continue to provide a steady light source. The downside is that players may not be able to tell when a hunt is occurring, especially if the ghost is too far away to be heard. In Sunny Meadows and its Restricted version, the candles in the chapel are lit by default and may be extinguished by the ghost, allowing the 'Get the Ghost to blow out a Firelight' objective to be completed without consuming a firelight or an igniter. However, this might also cause an unexpected early hunt if the ghost is an Onryo."

Additionally, lighting a held incense or firelight while the igniter is offhand in the inventory will instantly deduct 1 match for the Tier I and 15 seconds of the total fuel for the Tiers II and III. Active Tier I and Tier II igniters are affected by Heavy Rain, and will be extinguished automatically when taken outside and cannot be ignited in that weather, excepting places that are covered from the rain (e.g. under porch roofs, inside tents). However, they can still light held incense and Tier III firelights up if they are in the inventory, even while fully outside. Ghosts can occasionally blow out igniter flames within 5 metres of them.

The cooldown between photo depends on the Tier of the photo camera (3 seconds for Tier I, 2 seconds for Tier II, and 1 second for Tier III). When a ghost manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, the photo camera's display will be distorted, as well as any pictures taken. Pictures taken in this state will still be labeled in the journal if a valid subject is detected. Holding a Tier II or III photo camera within 7.5 metres of a ghost (2.5 metres for the Yokai) during a hunt on the same floor will attract the ghost. The Tier I photo camera will only attract the ghost when a picture is taken.

They can also be used to allow for further usage of cursed possessions such as Ouija Boards, to avoid breaking the possession. Sanity medication could even be used to identify ghosts based by seeing if they hunt above a certain threshold (e.g. Shade), or by performing a test for the Moroi. If one's aim is to delay hunts through sanity medication, specifically on multiplayer, one possible way to do this would be to distribute the sanity medication so that the overall sanity drain is slower on average. For example, if just one player is at 0% sanity and the remaining players have enough sanity to be above the hunt threshold, then these remaining players should take the sanity medication instead of the 0% player. This would make it so that less players are reducing the average sanity of the entire team. Another example is when all players are at varying levels of sanity; the players who tend to manage their sanity better could take the sanity medication, as long as this keeps the average sanity above the hunt threshold. Note that results may vary depending on factors such as the hunt sanity threshold, the ghost type, or players dying."
