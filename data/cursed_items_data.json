When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the favourite room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and equipment or players present in the room will be visible. The only exception is the player's own model. The mirror also gives a faint glow to see into the favourite room, which all players, including the user, can see, even outside of the mirror. This can help confirm rooms, as well as help other players know where the favourite room is. Each usage of the haunted mirror drains sanity at a rate of 7.5%/s, or 20% per use, whichever is higher. This means that using the mirror for less than ~2.67 seconds will still drain at least 20% sanity. This includes the animation of raising, but not lowering, the mirror. The mirror will crack visually and audibly, triggering a cursed hunt. Once broken, the mirror will lower and cannot be used again."

The Monkey Paw grants up to a certain number of wishes depending on the difficulty reward multiplier: 0x-1.99x: 5 wishes, 2x-2.99x: 4 wishes, 3x or higher: 3 wishes. The Monkey Paw can only be used within the investigation area, and players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to make wishes. If using voice chat, the Monkey Paw will grant any recognized wish made by the player. If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon pressing the Primary Use key. Players can then click to select one of 3 categories, then select a category-specific wish, or exit the UI by pressing the Primary Use key again. Every wish will come with a negative side effect, with the severity depending on the wish. If the Monkey Paw recognizes a valid phrase, regardless if it's a valid wish or not, or when entering/exiting the investigation area, its fingers will twitch. When a wish is being granted, one of its fingers will bend. When all fingers are bent, the Monkey Paw cannot be used anymore. Most wishes can be found on tags scattered in Sunny Meadows. Picking a tag up (except for weather and anything wishes) will record the wish in the journal. There is no need to find the wishes to use the Monkey Paw. Each wish can only be used once per contract.",

Be careful when speaking while holding it as you may accidentally call upon a wish. This is especially notable when using push-to-talk, as there are bugs that make the Monkey Paw listen to the player even if no voice chat button is being pressed. The vision loss from wishes is very significant, making it near impossible for a player afflicted by it to see more than a meter or so in front of them. While this can be partially circumvented by setting game brightness to a very high value, the affected player will be more or less rendered helpless and will need to be guarded accordingly."

However, they cannot self-extinguish except when lit while the player has less than 16% sanity. Relighting an extinguished candle will drain 16% sanity again for nearby players. Once all five candles are lit, the ghost is summoned and fully materialized, except a Shade, which has a chance of appearing as a transparent shadow. The summoned ghost stays motionless for 5 seconds, unable to kill players. This stationary period is considered a ghost event. However, the front door will lock immediately after lighting the last candle. After this event, the lights in the summoning circle's room will turn off and the ghost will immediately initiate a cursed hunt on the spot, without an additional 1-second grace period. Once the summoning circle is activated, it cannot be used again. In the following cases, there will be no 'ghost event' period; the cursed hunt will immediately begin, potentially killing players on the spot: If the player has 16% sanity or less when lighting the last candle, If the last candle is lit while a hunt is ongoing (this will not restart the current hunt's timer)."

There are 10 possible card types the player can draw, each having a unique effect on either the player or the ghost. After being used, each card will burn up and vanish in a uniquely-colored flame. Each card type has a different, independent chance of being drawn, so some card types can be drawn multiple times or not at all in a single deck. Once all ten cards have been used, no more will be given to the player for that contract.

Though tarot cards cannot be drawn outside of the investigation area, this can currently be bypassed by drawing a card and leaving while the animation is still ongoing. The card will still take effect. If, while using this method, no players are inside, drawing The Devil will do nothing, and drawing Death will not trigger a hunt but will still extend the duration of subsequent hunts. Trying to take a ghost photo after drawing The Devil can sometimes be tricky, as the card's burning animation needs to be completed before the player can drop the deck. If the triggered event is a singing ghost event, taking the photo will be easier, as this type of event usually lasts longer than the others. When playing in multiplayer, good coordination is useful if players want to take a ghost photo."
