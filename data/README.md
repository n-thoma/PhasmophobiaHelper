### I WANT MORE DATA!

If you want to add more data for the assistant, follow these simple steps:

1) Add a JSON file here in the ./data folder
2) Find the `config.json` file in the root folder
3) Inside `config.json`, add your JSON file to the list

```json
    "File_Paths": [
        "cursed_items_data.json",
        "equipment_data.json",
        "evidence_data.json",
        "ghost_data.json",
        "your_new_file.json"
    ]
```

Great, now the assistant has MORE KNOWLEDGE
