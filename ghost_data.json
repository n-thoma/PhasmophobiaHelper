A good strategy for detecting them is placing two video cameras in the corners of the room facing each other to maximize coverage, or using a Tier 2 or 3 tripod to rotate the camera. 4) Using video cameras to peer through exit doors, garage doors or windows may allow the player to find Ghost Orbs even before entering the investigation area. 5) Ghost Orbs tend to show up in regular intervals. If none are seen for a long time, try moving the video camera or switch to another one. 6) In outdoor areas such as on Maple Lodge Campsite, Ghost Orbs can be hard to see in bad weather conditions (primarily rain, snow, and fog). A hint to distinguishing them from snowflakes is that Ghost Orbs tend to float more horizontally and, sometimes, even upwards (compared to snowflakes always falling down). Additionally, snowflakes are generally dark, while orbs will be bright. 7) It is best to check for Ghost Orbs when the room's lights are off. When on, the brightness may hide the Orbs from sight."

If the favourite room is small, consider placing the D.O.T.S Projector in a neighbouring room to aid visibility. The Projector emits a substantial amount of light when placed. Investigators can use them for illumination, especially with a spare Projector or when D.O.T.S evidence can be safely crossed off. Note that the D.O.T.S projector light does not mitigate sanity drain. The Tier II and III D.O.T.S Projectors can be placed on some ceilings in a few maps, which may allow the light to cover a room with much more consistency. This is especially useful for the tier III projector, whose sweeping motions and cone-shaped light area can cause the ghost to potentially leave its light prematurely depending on the ghost's and the projector's movement. The green light emitted may obscure nearby fingerprints or footprints; look carefully or remove the projector when checking for ultraviolet evidence. Some visual effects such as freezing breath or Incense smoke will reflect the D.O.T.S Projector's light. Be careful to not confuse them with a D.O.T.S silhouette. There is currently a bug where the ghost can initiate a ghost event or a hunt while in 'D.O.T.S state'.

Holding F will show the default effective range for the crucifix; this is a translucent sphere with a radius depending on its tier level (even if the ghost has a different effective range): Tier I: 3 metres, Tier II: 4 metres, Tier III: 5 metres. When the ghost attempts to initiate a hunt within the crucifix's range, the hunt will fail to begin, and a charge will be used. The ghost is then teleported back to its favourite room. Each time a crucifix successfully prevents a hunt, an EMF Level 2 reading is created, with a 25% chance for this to be EMF Level 5 if it is one of the ghost's evidences. For the Demon, the crucifix's effective range is increased by 50% for each tier: Tier I: 4.5 metres, Tier II: 6 metres, Tier III: 7.5 metres. The Tier I crucifix only has one charge, while tier II and tier III both have two charges. Each time it blocks a hunt attempt, a burning effect will appear, and the crucifix will glow visually before fading slightly darker. On first use, one arm of the crucifix will disappear. On second use, more parts of the crucifix will disappear. If a player-held crucifix successfully prevents a hunt attempt, it will automatically be thrown on the ground. After the crucifix is completely burnt, the crucifix will be useless and have no further effect on the ghost. In addition, the crucifix will not work if: The ghost is not within the specified range (even if the crucifix is located in the favourite room), A cursed possession is used to initiate a cursed hunt (Except for in the case of an unused tier III crucifix, which can be used to stop a cursed hunt at the cost of both its charges), A hunt has already started/is in progress. Each time a crucifix is used, the ghost must wait a minimum of 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before attempting to initiate another hunt. The crucifix range is not limited by any obstacle such as walls and doors. This includes exterior walls, which means that it is possible for crucifixes to be used outside provided the ghost is within its range inside the investigation area. 42 Edgefield Road is a good example of this, where a ghost near the front of the house, even upstairs, could possibly use up a crucifix still hanging on the van wall.",

Ghosts can blow out firelights at any time, even during hunts. A firelight will also extinguish by itself at the end of its duration which depends on its tier level. Tier I and Tier II firelights will produce smoke when blown by the ghost or self-extinguishing. Every third firelight that an Onryo blows out will cause it to attempt to initiate a hunt, regardless of sanity; the frequency of it blowing out firelights increases for every dead player. Having firelights nearby also act as crucifixes, being blown out instead of the Onryo hunting. Throwing a lit firelight/one falling with sufficient velocity (Tiers I and II only), placing it in the inventory, or leaving it out in heavy rain (Tiers I and II only) will cause it to extinguish. When a player is within 2 metres of a lit firelight, it will slow passive sanity drain that results from being in the dark, at a rate depending on the firelight's tier level. Lit firelights do not affect sanity drain from other sources such as ghost events or other players dying. The Tier II firelight counts as a single flame for all purposes."

In larger maps like Brownstone High School or Sunny Meadows Mental Institution, firelights may be helpful as navigation markers for important areas such as the fuse box, ghost room, or exit door(s), though they are not as reliable as UV lights or spare flashlights, as firelights both burn out after a time (except for tier III) and can be blown out by the ghost. As firelights are not electronic, they are not affected by hunts and will continue to provide a steady light source. The downside is that players may not be able to tell when a hunt is occurring, especially if the ghost is too far away to be heard. In Sunny Meadows and its Restricted version, the candles in the chapel are lit by default and may be extinguished by the ghost, allowing the 'Get the Ghost to blow out a Firelight' objective to be completed without consuming a firelight or an igniter. However, this might also cause an unexpected early hunt if the ghost is an Onryo."

Any pictures taken of a reflective surface will show the lens flash in the picture, such as a television, or the axe that one of the possible ghost models wields. The cooldown between photo depends on the Tier of the photo camera (3 seconds for Tier I, 2 seconds for Tier II, and 1 second for Tier III). When a ghost manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, the photo camera's display will be distorted, as well as any pictures taken. Pictures taken in this state will still be labeled in the journal if a valid subject is detected. Holding a Tier II or III photo camera within 7.5 metres of a ghost (2.5 metres for the Yokai) during a hunt on the same floor will attract the ghost. The Tier I photo camera will only attract the ghost when a picture is taken.

They can also be used to allow for further usage of cursed possessions such as Ouija Boards, to avoid breaking the possession. Sanity medication could even be used to identify ghosts based by seeing if they hunt above a certain threshold (e.g. Shade), or by performing a test for the Moroi. If one's aim is to delay hunts through sanity medication, specifically on multiplayer, one possible way to do this would be to distribute the sanity medication so that the overall sanity drain is slower on average. For example, if just one player is at 0% sanity and the remaining players have enough sanity to be above the hunt threshold, then these remaining players should take the sanity medication instead of the 0% player. This would make it so that less players are reducing the average sanity of the entire team. Another example is when all players are at varying levels of sanity; the players who tend to manage their sanity better could take the sanity medication, as long as this keeps the average sanity above the hunt threshold. Note that results may vary depending on factors such as the hunt sanity threshold, the ghost type, or players dying."

When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the favourite room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and equipment or players present in the room will be visible. The only exception is the player's own model. The mirror also gives a faint glow to see into the favourite room, which all players, including the user, can see, even outside of the mirror. This can help confirm rooms, as well as help other players know where the favourite room is. Each usage of the haunted mirror drains sanity at a rate of 7.5%/s, or 20% per use, whichever is higher. This means that using the mirror for less than ~2.67 seconds will still drain at least 20% sanity. This includes the animation of raising, but not lowering, the mirror. The mirror will crack visually and audibly, triggering a cursed hunt. Once broken, the mirror will lower and cannot be used again."

The Monkey Paw can only be used within the investigation area, and players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to make wishes. If using voice chat, the Monkey Paw will grant any recognized wish made by the player. If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon pressing the Primary Use key. Players can then click to select one of 3 categories, then select a category-specific wish, or exit the UI by pressing the Primary Use key again. Every wish will come with a negative side effect, with the severity depending on the wish. If the Monkey Paw recognizes a valid phrase, regardless if it's a valid wish or not, or when entering/exiting the investigation area, its fingers will twitch. When a wish is being granted, one of its fingers will bend. When all fingers are bent, the Monkey Paw cannot be used anymore. Most wishes can be found on tags scattered in Sunny Meadows. Picking a tag up (except for weather and anything wishes) will record the wish in the journal. There is no need to find the wishes to use the Monkey Paw.

Be careful when speaking while holding it as you may accidentally call upon a wish. This is especially notable when using push-to-talk, as there are bugs that make the Monkey Paw listen to the player even if no voice chat button is being pressed. The vision loss from wishes is very significant, making it near impossible for a player afflicted by it to see more than a meter or so in front of them. While this can be partially circumvented by setting game brightness to a very high value, the affected player will be more or less rendered helpless and will need to be guarded accordingly."

However, they cannot self-extinguish except when lit while the player has less than 16% sanity. Relighting an extinguished candle will drain 16% sanity again for nearby players. Once all five candles are lit, the ghost is summoned and fully materialized, except a Shade, which has a chance of appearing as a transparent shadow. The summoned ghost stays motionless for 5 seconds, unable to kill players. This stationary period is considered a ghost event. However, the front door will lock immediately after lighting the last candle. After this event, the lights in the summoning circle's room will turn off and the ghost will immediately initiate a cursed hunt on the spot, without an additional 1-second grace period. Once the summoning circle is activated, it cannot be used again. In the following cases, there will be no 'ghost event' period; the cursed hunt will immediately begin, potentially killing players on the spot: If the player has 16% sanity or less when lighting the last candle, If the last candle is lit while a hunt is ongoing (this will not restart the current hunt's timer)."

There are 10 possible card types the player can draw, each having a unique effect on either the player or the ghost. After being used, each card will burn up and vanish in a uniquely-colored flame. Each card type has a different, independent chance of being drawn, so some card types can be drawn multiple times or not at all in a single deck. Once all ten cards have been used, no more will be given to the player for that contract. When the deck is used up, all future hunts will also be extended by 20 seconds, even if no Death card was drawn prior.",

Players should take a photo of the cards before using them, as once all of the cards are used, the deck will disappear and no photo can be taken. Though tarot cards cannot be drawn outside of the investigation area, this can currently be bypassed by drawing a card and leaving while the animation is still ongoing. The card will still take effect. If, while using this method, no players are inside, drawing The Devil will do nothing, and drawing Death will not trigger a hunt but will still extend the duration of subsequent hunts. Trying to take a ghost photo after drawing The Devil can sometimes be tricky, as the card's burning animation needs to be completed before the player can drop the deck. If the triggered event is a singing ghost event, taking the photo will be easier, as this type of event usually lasts longer than the others. When playing in multiplayer, good coordination is useful if players want to take a ghost photo."
